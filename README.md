Hey there! You've found the repo for my <a href="https://nickbrombal.codes" target="_nicks-cv">personal CV website</a>. I can't pretend it's particularly exciting, but feel free to poke around.

The goal with this site, as you can probably guess, is to have a living document where I can keep my relevant skills and work history available to prospective employers. Beyond that, I've simply attempted to keep the project as minimal as possible, utilizing raw HTML and CSS rather than introducing an entire build pipeline and complicated dependency tree. Sometimes it's nice to get back to the basics and remember where this whole internet thing started.

To get in touch with me and learn a little more about my work, swing on over to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbrombal/" target="_nicks-linkedin-profile">my LinkedIn profile</a>. I'm always happy to meet someone new!
